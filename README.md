# What's Cooking? Client

In the past, recipes were passed down through families on hand-written cards or gathered in cookbooks with notes jotted in the margins.
Now you can share all of your favorite recipes with loved ones near and far. Donâ€™t forget to include the secret ingredient!

What's Cooking? is a recipe management app that allow you to share your recipes with others. 

A user can create an account and add their own recipes to share. From the Recipes Page a user can view all of the recipes that have been added to the app and can save any recipe to their own cookbook. 

A user can also make a personal note on any recipe, ex. "Add less salt" or "Bake longer next time". This note is only viewable to the viewer.

Other user's cookbooks can also be viewed by clicking on the "Added by:" on the recipe's details page. 


## Setup

Start the API server first (see repo for What's Cooking? Server)

Need to run command npm install first
```bash
npm install 
```

Use command npm start to start the app.
```bash
npm start
```

## Technologies Used
SPA frontend built with React.

## Components and Pages Structure



## Future Work
There are many things I would like to add to this project, especially more interactive features for the user such as:

Ratings system for user's to rate the recipes.

Ability for users to be able to follow eachother and receive recipe suggestions or notifications based on the recipes their connected users are adding.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
